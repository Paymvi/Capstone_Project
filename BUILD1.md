## What Works Now
* Interactive map with persistent markers  

* Customizable avatar with equip system  

* User login with persistent user data  

* Background music and sound effects integrated into the user experience 


## What Doesn't Work Now
* Profile pages (UI and backend routes incomplete)  

* Google OAuth integration (partially implemented but not fully verified)  

* Device geolocation for Pegman positioning  

* Full PostgreSQL integration (currently using local JSON storage for persistence)  


## Top 3 Build 2 Priorities
1. Profile Page

2. Pegman using device location

3. Password security

## Extra Priorities 
* Admin page for managing item drops  

* Migrate persistent storage to PostgreSQL for scalability
